# Issues

**Attention!**
_Project_ related issues should be reported the way described in the _Project's own Issues_ page.
This place is for reporting issues of the main site only!


Known issues are tracked on the [FUMBBLPlus Issues] page.
This page should be checked whether a bug is known before reporting.

Registered [GitHub] members can create a _New Issue_ on the [FUMBBLPlus Issues] page directly.

Others should report to the Administrators in a [FUMBBL] Message.

Click [HERE][AdminPM] to do that.


# Linguistic errors

There may be a lot of linguistic errors in the documentations and help pages due to the limited English of their original authors (at this time [SzieberthAdam] only).
**Fixes are very welcome** and should be reported in the same way as _Issues_!
